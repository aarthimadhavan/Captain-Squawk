<p>From the creator of this game, Captain Squawk, we do not collect or store any data. Your highscore will be used only for display purposes. As we don't collect or store any data, we also can't share any data. We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even use a server database to store it. That's why, with Captain Squawk, what happens on your smartphone stays on your smartphone.</p>
