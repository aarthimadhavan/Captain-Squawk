<p>From the creator of this game, Pandio, we do not collect or store any data. Your "Name" that you provide at the start of the game will be used only for display purposes. As we don't collect or store any data, we also can't share any data. We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even use a server database to store it. That's why, with Pandio, what happens on your smartphone stays on your smartphone.</p>
